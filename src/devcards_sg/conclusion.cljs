  "Poor man's playground, although you need a big screen!

  * Provide a nice workflow for clojurescript development
  * Deserve a try if you are developing with TDD, Component etc.
  * Nice try to use it as a documentation tools especially as a library developer.")

(dc/defcard Further
  "
  * Dive in with the libs you work with like om, om-next, react or rum etc.
  * Integrate with clojure.spec and generate the demonstration cards or generative test cards
